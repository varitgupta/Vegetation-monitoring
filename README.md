# Satellite Data for Vegetation Monitoring in the Kalahari
The ecosystems around the globe have been disrupted due to various factors, like increasing
populations, extinction of animals and climate change which has drastically affected the vegetation
patterns. This has necessitated the need to construct wildlife reserves and sanctuaries to protect the
flora and fauna. These vast areas of land span over thousands of acres and need complex
management to maintain the ecology of these spaces. This task is tedious and expensive with less
accuracy if done manually, and hence we can use the advent of modern Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning technologies to provide effective and efficient solutions.
Our project is aimed at vegetation monitoring of the Kuzikus wildlife reserve in the Kalahari region in
Namibia, Africa. Here we propose to develop deep learning models to predict the images of the
vegetation cover over the reserve based on past satellite images.
